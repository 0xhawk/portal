## Technical overview

The VETKeys feature is in ongoing development on the Internet Computer (IC). It stands for ‘Verifiable Encrypted Threshold Keys’ and enables a number of cryptographic functionalities on the IC. The primary motivation for VETKeys is to facilitate onchain encryption, as such we focus this primer with that example in mind.
