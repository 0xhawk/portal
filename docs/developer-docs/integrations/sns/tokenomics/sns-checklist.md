#SNS Preparation Checklist

:::caution
This guide is intended for informational purposes only and may be modified over time as 
appropriate. It is aimed to provide general guidance for projects that are planning to launch 
an SNS but should not be construed as the definitive list of action items that need to be taken
in preparation of any such launch. Following this guide is not a guarantee of a successful SNS
launch â€“ that is a decision by the NNS DAO. Ultimately, following this guide and/or launching
an SNS is done at your own risk.
